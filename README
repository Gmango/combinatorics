    =========================================
    
     This Processing library provides iterators for these
     combinatorics sets:
     
     – Combinations
     – CombinationSets
     – Variations
     – VariationSets
     – Permutations
     
     The iterators provide arrays of indices (addresses) into
     an imaginary array of a given length at each step. These
     adresses can then be used on any kind of real array.
     
     
     Say you have a String array:
     
     { "A", "B", "C" }
     
     ... and you'd like to find all possible combinations at any length.
     A CombinationSet could return these indice arrays:
     
     []                       empty (0 elements)
     [0], [1], [2]            combinations of 1 element
     [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2]   combinations of 2 elements
     [0, 1, 2]                combinations of 3 elements
     
     Using these indices to read from your array would give you:
     
     (null)
     ["A"], ["B"], ["C"]
     ["A", "B"], ["A", "C"], ["B", "C"]
     ["A", "B", "C"]
     
     
     A quick overview:
     
     class Combination      unique combinations, no duplications, order is ignored
     class CombinationSet   range of combinations at different lengths
     class Variation        all possible variations, includes duplication, order matters
     class VariationSet     range of variations at different lengths
     class Permutation      all possible ways to order the elements, no duplications
